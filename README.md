# vault-key-rotation
A project that can rotate GCP keys configured in Hashicorp Vault.

The package can interrogate a [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) server and retrive information about rolesets and static accounts configured on GCP secrets engines.  The keys assocaiated with these rolsets and static accounts can then be rotated.
